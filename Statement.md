Problem Statement

Managing vehicle rentals manually is often inefficient and prone to errors, especially when multiple vehicles and customers are involved. Businesses and individuals may struggle with tracking which vehicles are available, calculating rental costs, and maintaining records of ongoing and completed rentals. There is a need for a tool that can automate these processes, reduce errors, and provide a clear, organized system for vehicle rental management.

Scope of Project

This project aims to develop a Python-based Vehicle Rental System that allows users to add vehicles, view availability, rent vehicles, and process returns. The system will track rental records, calculate total costs, and maintain a simple record of all transactions. It focuses on providing a reliable, user-friendly command-line interface without requiring external databases or libraries.
